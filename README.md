# Introduction

QDraw leverages the power of quantum computing through the Qiskit framework, in conjunction with the robust machine learning capabilities of PyTorch, to provide an advanced sketch recognition system. This project aims to push the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of digital sketch analysis by harnessing the parallel processing and unique problem-solving capabilities of quantum algorithms.

## Features

- **Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning:** Integrates quantum algorithms with deep learning models for improved efficiency and performance in sketch recognition.
- **Qiskit Integration:** Utilizes the versatile Qiskit framework for implementing quantum computing operations, making QDraw at the forefront of quantum-assisted applications.
- **PyTorch Support:** Leverages PyTorch for its dynamic computation graph and extensive library support, ensuring seamless integration of classical and quantum computing elements.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Designed to handle real-time sketch recognition tasks with enhanced speed and accuracy thanks to the quantum computing backend.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to draw, submit sketches, and receive instant recognition feedback.
